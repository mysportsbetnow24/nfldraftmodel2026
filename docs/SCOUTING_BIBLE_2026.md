# 2026 Scouting Bible (Living Document)

## Core philosophy

- Anchor grade on translatable traits first, then production, then projection risk.
- Force role clarity: every prospect must have a defined NFL role by Year 1.
- Separate floor and ceiling explicitly.
- Discount empty production (scheme inflation, low-pressure environment, weak competition).
- Reward repeatable wins under NFL-like constraints: tight windows, condensed space, late-down leverage, and physical mismatch.

## Legacy scouting logic integrated

1. Parcells-style baseline checks (adapted)
- Multi-year starter signal preferred.
- Dominant level of play and growth trend required.
- Positional body type and movement baseline required.
- Football character, durability, and role consistency are non-negotiable.

2. Belichick-style team building principles (adapted)
- Role fit over raw talent.
- Multiplicity and situational value (3rd down, red zone, 2-minute) increase final grade.
- Smart/tough/dependable modifiers are explicit and additive.

3. Walsh-style projection principles (adapted)
- Grade timing/anticipation and processing speed higher than raw arm/40-time when role demands it.
- Traits are evaluated in the context of system spacing and route timing.

## Grade bands -> round projection

- 92-100: Round 1 (blue chip)
- 88-91.9: Round 1-2
- 84-87.9: Round 2-3
- 80-83.9: Round 3-4
- 76-79.9: Round 4-5
- 72-75.9: Round 5-6
- 68-71.9: Round 6-7
- <68: priority free agent

## Athletic thresholds (baseline)

- QB: >=6'2", >=215; functional movement and drive velocity required.
- RB: >=200 preferred unless elite speed/receiving.
- WR outside: >=5'11", >=185 with verified separation trait.
- TE: >=6'4", >=245 and in-line blocking floor.
- OT: >=6'5", >=310, arm length threshold role-dependent.
- IOL: >=6'2", >=300 with anchor and lateral floor.
- EDGE: >=6'3", >=250 with bend or power outlier.
- DT: >=290 with role-specific mass (1T heavier, 3T quicker).
- LB: >=225 with verified processing/range.
- CB: >=5'10", >=185 unless elite movement profile.
- S: >=200 preferred for box/overhang roles.

## Unique player identifier (core stat)

Prospect Signature Index (PSI)
- PSI = 0.45 * film_trait_score + 0.30 * production_z + 0.15 * athletic_z + 0.10 * size_z
- Position-specific PSI variants adjust production inputs (example: pressure rate for EDGE, target share for WR, turnover-worthy play avoidance for QB).

Use PSI for:
- Historical comp search
- Tiering within positions
- Risk-adjusted board ordering
