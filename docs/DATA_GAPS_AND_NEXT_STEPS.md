# Data Gaps And Next Steps

## High-priority gaps

1. Verified combine/pro day data for full class.
2. Official all-seven-round order with comp picks in machine format.
3. Paid analyst board exports (Brugler, McShay, full PFF fields).
4. Injury and medical red-flag history.
5. Coordinator/scheme tagging at coach-tree resolution.

## Next pulls after approval

1. Odds API batch pull for draft markets (single daily snapshot + event-day refresh cadence).
2. Full nflverse + cfbfastr historical pull for 2016-2025 calibration.
3. Recruit + age + transfer history merge for age-adjusted projection model.

## Model refinement track

1. Add separate models by position family (passer, pass catcher, trench, coverage).
2. Add Bayesian shrinkage for one-year breakouts.
3. Build uncertainty intervals on grade and round projection.
4. Add counterfactual team-fit score under multiple scheme trees.
