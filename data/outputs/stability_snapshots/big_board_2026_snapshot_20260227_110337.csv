prospect due to his loose, fluid movement skills and relentless motor that allows him to get out of compromising positions, strain and sustain blocks at a high level. Fano carries a fringe first-round grade due to a lean, light-in-the-pants build that calls into question his ability to consistently generate movement at the next level.
