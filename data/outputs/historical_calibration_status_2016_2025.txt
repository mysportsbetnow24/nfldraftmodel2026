Historical calibration status: BLOCKED
Date: 2026-02-27

Reason:
- Missing required input file:
  data/sources/manual/historical_draft_outcomes_2016_2025.csv

Required columns:
- draft_year, overall_pick, draft_round, position, model_grade, ras, pff_grade,
  career_value, starter_seasons, second_contract, success_label, data_source

Notes:
- Year-based leakage-safe backtest is already implemented in scripts/calibrate_historical_model.py
  via src/modeling/calibration.py::year_based_backtest.
- Once this CSV is added, run:
  python3 scripts/calibrate_historical_model.py
