2026 NFL draft class. McCoy is explosive, twitchy, physical and can do anything asked of him in the secondary. His combination of suffocating man coverage and instinctual zone ability is impressive. Missing the 2025 season due to a torn ACL hurt his development arc, as he played only two seasons. He'll be fully healthy by the time his NFL rookie season begins, though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,98.0,14,95.67,51.07,48,0,0,,McCoy has yet to play this season while recovering from a torn ACL in January.
