# Team Athletic Thresholds (2026, Historical + Public Evidence)

Interpretation:
- Premium positions: QB/OT/EDGE/CB
- Mid-value positions: WR/S/DT/LB
- Low-value positions: IOL/TE/RB
- `explicit_rb_source=yes` means a public team-specific RB archetype threshold article was found (The 33rd Team).
- Otherwise thresholds are inferred from 2021-2025 team draft athletic trends.
- Bumps applied: premium `+0.00`, mid `+0.00`, low `+0.00`.
