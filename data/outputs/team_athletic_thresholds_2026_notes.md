# Team Athletic Threshold Notes (2026)

- `explicit_public_rb_threshold_source_found=yes` means I found evidence of a published team-specific RB archetype/threshold article (The 33rd Team series).
- `no` means no equivalent explicit team threshold article was found in this pass; thresholds are inferred from team draft RAS behavior.
- Suggested thresholds are implementation guardrails for mock logic and fit scoring (soft caps), not hard exclusion rules.
