NFL Draft Model Formula Guide (Layman's Terms)
Updated: 2026-02-27

1) Big Picture
- The model does two things:
- It builds an internal football grade from traits, production, athletic profile, size, context, and risk.
- It blends that with outside market evidence (consensus boards + analyst ranks) so outliers are controlled.

2) Final Grade Flow
- Step A: Build prior signal (market/analyst anchor), 1-100 scale.
- Step B: Build core components:
- trait_component
- production_component
- athletic_component
- size_component
- context_component
- risk_penalty
- Step C: Raw formula score = weighted components minus risk.
- Step D: Convert raw score to grade scale (55-95), then blend with prior grade.
- Step E: Apply guardrails/caps (consensus drift, soft/hard caps, outlier gates).
- Step F: Sort by final grade for board rank.

3) Core Formula (Current)
- raw_formula_score =
- trait_w * trait_component
- + prod_w * production_component
- + athletic_w * athletic_component
- + size_w * size_component
- + context_w * context_component
- - risk_penalty

- calibrated_grade = clamp(1.22 * raw_formula_score - 2.0, 55, 95)
- prior_grade = clamp(60 + 0.33 * prior_signal, 55, 95)
- formula_score = clamp(0.72 * calibrated_grade + 0.28 * prior_grade + position_value_adjustment, 55, 95)

4) Component Weights
- Default positions:
- trait 0.38
- production 0.24
- athletic 0.18
- size 0.10
- context 0.10

- Front-7 (EDGE/DT/LB):
- trait 0.42
- production 0.18
- athletic 0.18
- size 0.10
- context 0.12

5) What Each Component Means
- prior_signal: What the market and analysts already think.
- trait_component: Tape/scouting language quality (how skills translate).
- production_component: On-field output signals (PFF + ESPN + CFB/PP where present).
- athletic_component: Movement/testing profile (official RAS preferred).
- size_component: How body type fits NFL standards for that position.
- context_component: Experience/class + information confidence context.
- risk_penalty: Volatility, sparse profile, and uncertainty deductions.

6) Prior Signal Inputs (Weighted Blend)
- Seed rank signal
- External rank signal
- Analyst aggregate signal
- Consensus board signal
- Kiper rank signal
- TDN rank signal
- Ringer rank signal
- Bleacher rank signal
- AtoZ rank signal
- SI rank signal
- CBS rank signal
- CBS Wilson rank signal
- TDN grade-label signal
- Then a consensus anchor adjustment is applied to reduce seed-vs-market drift.

7) Production Logic (Current)
- Production starts from weighted parts:
- PFF grade (0.42 default, 0.30 front-7, 0.34 CB/S)
- ESPN production signal (0.24)
- PlayerProfiler skill signal (0.12 when available)
- CFB production signal (reliability and coverage adjusted)

- Production guardrail (anti-overweight):
- Neutral center = 70
- Multipliers:
- QB 0.74
- Front-7 0.68
- Others 0.82
- Max movement caps apply (front-7 upside capped tighter).
- Front-7 gets extra compression after guardrail.
- Thin proxy front-7 production is capped.

8) Athletic Logic (Current)
- If official RAS exists:
- athletic_component = RAS * 10
- If no official RAS:
- use MockDraftable component percentiles (speed/explosion/agility)
- Front-7 evidence cap:
- 1 athletic evidence metric: cap at 78
- 2 metrics: cap at 86

- Purpose: prevent one fast split from looking like elite complete athleticism.

9) Size Logic
- Position-specific thresholds are used (not one global standard).
- Below threshold gets penalized more heavily.
- Above threshold gets only mild penalties past a soft upper range.

10) Risk and Data Sufficiency
- Risk adds penalties for:
- volatility/inconsistency flags
- missing evidence types
- thin proxy-only production
- QB uncertainty (stricter)

- Evidence guardrail:
- If final grade is high but evidence is thin, apply small confidence haircut.

11) Post-Formula Guardrails (Board Control)
- formula_guardrail_penalty: suppress weak-consensus outliers.
- formula_drift_penalty: penalize large seed-vs-consensus drift.
- formula_midband_brake_penalty: mild brake in consensus mid-range.
- formula_top75_gate_penalty: gate for very low-consensus players (unless exception).
- formula_soft_ceiling_penalty: soft ceiling in selected mid-bands.
- formula_hard_cap_penalty: hard cap if consensus support is too weak.
- formula_consensus_outlier_cap: broad ceiling for persistent low-consensus names.
- is_diamond_exception: allows verified contrarian profiles to pass with reduced brakes.

12) Position Value Adjustment
- Small bonus/penalty by position after formula blend:
- QB +0.35, OT +0.25, EDGE +0.25, CB +0.20, WR +0.15
- DT +0.10, S +0.10, LB +0.05
- TE -0.15, IOL -0.25, RB -0.80

13) Legacy vs Active Fields
- Legacy diagnostic fields still exist:
- trait_score, production_score, athletic_score, final_grade (from base grade module)
- Active ranking pipeline uses:
- formula_* fields plus guardrail/cap penalties in build_big_board.py.

14) Practical Read of a Player Row
- Check these first:
- final_grade (current model result)
- formula_trait_component
- formula_production_component
- formula_athletic_component
- formula_risk_penalty
- formula_prior_grade
- formula_guardrail_penalty
- formula_drift_penalty
- formula_midband_brake_penalty
- formula_soft_ceiling_penalty
- formula_hard_cap_penalty
- consensus_board_mean_rank / consensus_board_source_count
- formula_evidence_guardrail_penalty
