Opponent-Adjusted Production Update (2026-02-28)

What was added
- Opponent defensive strength context from CFBD team defense metrics (EPA/ppa allowed + success rate allowed).
- Production adjustment applied only for offense positions (QB/WR/TE/RB).
- Neutral fallback: if context is missing, adjustment = 0 (no penalty).
- Hard cap: per-player adjustment delta is limited to +/- 2.4 production-signal points.
