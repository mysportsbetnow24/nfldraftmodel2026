CFB Proxy Audit Fields (Added)

Purpose
- Show exactly which proxy metrics were used for each player.
- Show whether a metric came from direct row input or fallback derivation.
- Show conservative sub-metric weights when fallback logic was triggered.

New columns in big_board_2026.csv
- cfb_proxy_audit_summary
- cfb_prod_proxy_fallback_features
- cfb_wrte_targets_per_route_source
- cfb_wrte_targets_per_route_weight
- cfb_edge_sacks_per_pr_snap_source
- cfb_edge_pressure_weight
- cfb_edge_sack_weight
- cfb_db_yards_allowed_per_cov_snap_source
- cfb_db_cov_weight
- cfb_db_yacs_weight

Conservative fallback logic
- WR/TE targets_per_route_run:
  - direct weight: 0.20
  - derived fallback weight: 0.10
- EDGE sacks_per_pass_rush_snap:
  - direct sack weight: 0.28
  - derived from sacks/pressures: 0.16
  - derived from pressure-only conversion: 0.08
  - pressure weight is rebalanced to (1 - sack_weight)
- CB/S yards_allowed_per_coverage_snap:
  - direct yacs weight: 0.45
  - derived fallback yacs weight: 0.20
  - coverage weight is rebalanced to (1 - yacs_weight)

Missing-data behavior
- No hard penalty for missing proxies.
- Neutral handling remains in place via cfb_prod_quality/reliability and guarded downstream blending.
