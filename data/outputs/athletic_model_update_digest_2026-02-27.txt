Athletic Model Update (2026-02-27)

Implemented features:
1) Position-adjusted + era-adjusted athletic scoring
- Source: data/sources/external/nfl-combine-evaluation/data/NFLCombineStats1999-2015.csv
- Logic: blended percentile + z-score by position and modern era (recent years weighted higher).

2) Event composites
- speed: forty, ten_split
- explosion: vertical, broad, bench
- agility: shuttle, three_cone
- size-adjusted: height, weight, arms, hands
- Final athletic profile score uses position-specific event weights.

3) Historical hit-rate bins (combine profile -> draft capital outcomes)
- Bin by athletic profile decile.
- Outputs per bin:
  - athletic_hit_rate_round12_bin (proxy hit: pick <= 64)
  - athletic_hit_rate_top100_bin (proxy hit: pick <= 100)
  - athletic_hit_bin_sample_n

4) Nearest-neighbor athletic comps
- Objective nearest neighbors from historical combine vectors (position matched).
- Outputs:
  - athletic_nn_comp_1/2/3 + year + picktotal + similarity
  - athletic_comp_confidence

5) Missing-data handling (neutral defaults + variance penalty)
- Sparse profiles regress toward neutral athletic score instead of spiking.
- Mild penalties exported:
  - athletic_missing_penalty
  - athletic_variance_penalty
- Penalties are applied in formula as guarded risk terms.

Where integrated:
- New module: src/ingest/athletic_profile_loader.py
- Wired into board build: scripts/build_big_board.py

Key output columns now available in big_board:
- athletic_profile_score
- athletic_speed_score
- athletic_explosion_score
- athletic_agility_score
- athletic_size_adj_score
- athletic_metric_coverage_count / expected_count / missing_count / coverage_rate
- athletic_missing_penalty / athletic_variance_penalty
- athletic_hit_bin / athletic_hit_bin_sample_n
- athletic_hit_rate_round12_bin / athletic_hit_rate_top100_bin
- athletic_comp_confidence
- athletic_nn_comp_1..3 (+ year/picktotal/similarity)
- formula_athletic_source
- athletic_pct_* and athletic_z_* metric diagnostics
