CFBfastr P0 Metrics Added (Layman's Guide)

Goal:
Use stronger college efficiency data to sharpen rankings WITHOUT letting production stats hijack the board.

How this is protected:
- New P0 metrics are blended into existing player production signal, not replacing it.
- Blend weight: 35% P0, 65% legacy production.
- Max movement from P0 layer:
  - QB: +/-3.0 signal points
  - Other positions: +/-4.0 signal points
- If only P0 exists (no legacy), we still anchor to neutral and cap impact.

QB metrics added:
1) qb_wepa_passing
- What it is: opponent/context-adjusted passing impact.
- Why it helps: better than raw yards/TDs when schedule/context differ.

2) qb_ppa_passing
- What it is: passing efficiency per-play value.
- Why it helps: captures how much each passing play actually helps scoring expectation.

3) qb_ppa_overall
- What it is: all-play PPA impact.
- Why it helps: balances pure passing splits with total on-field impact.

4) qb_ppa_passing_downs
- What it is: efficiency on obvious pass downs.
- Why it helps: shows translatable “must-pass” execution.

5) qb_ppa_standard_downs
- What it is: efficiency on early/normal downs.
- Why it helps: avoids overvaluing only scramble/late-down chaos.

6) qb_usage_rate
- What it is: how much offense flows through the QB.
- Why it helps: role/context check for whether production came on real volume.

WR/TE metrics added:
1) wrte_wepa_receiving
- What it is: context-adjusted receiving impact.
- Why it helps: isolates real receiving value vs. raw volume.

2) wrte_ppa_overall
- What it is: overall per-play value for usage involving this player.
- Why it helps: measures down-to-down contribution, not just splash plays.

3) wrte_ppa_passing_downs
- What it is: value on passing downs.
- Why it helps: targets NFL-translation situations.

4) wrte_usage_rate
- What it is: player involvement rate.
- Why it helps: production sustainability check (high value on low usage can be volatile).

RB metrics added:
1) rb_wepa_rushing
- What it is: context-adjusted rushing impact.
- Why it helps: separates RB performance from line/schedule inflation.

2) rb_ppa_rushing
- What it is: rushing per-play value.
- Why it helps: better signal than raw rushing totals.

3) rb_ppa_standard_downs
- What it is: early-down rushing value.
- Why it helps: aligns with NFL run-game translation.

4) rb_usage_rate
- What it is: workload share.
- Why it helps: checks whether efficiency holds at meaningful volume.

Where these show up now:
- In cfb production ingestion logic (guardrailed blend).
- In big board output columns:
  - cfbfastr_p0_signal_raw
  - cfbfastr_p0_available
  - cfbfastr_p0_mode
  - cfbfastr_p0_applied_delta
  - cfbfastr_p0_max_delta
  - cfbfastr_p0_coverage_count

What to fill in manually right now:
- data/sources/manual/cfb_production_2025_template.csv now includes the new P0 columns.
- Once you paste values, rerun build_big_board.py.

Key constraint preserved:
- Team-level CFB stats are still blocked from NFL team-needs logic and from direct player grade inflation.
