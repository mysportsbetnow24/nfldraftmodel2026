He racked up 82 tackles, 4.5 for loss, 19 pass breakups, three interceptions, three forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries and a sack in his first two seasons.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","19","94.0","30","90.33","50.64","29","0","0","","Terrell may not look imposing at 180 pounds, but he plays extremely physical football.

2026 NFL draft class. McCoy is explosive, twitchy, physical and can do anything asked of him in the secondary. His combination of suffocating man coverage and instinctual zone ability is impressive. Missing the 2025 season due to a torn ACL hurt his development arc, as he played only two seasons. He'll be fully healthy by the time his NFL rookie season begins, though.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7","98.0","14","95.67","51.07","48","0","0","","McCoy has yet to play this season while recovering from a torn ACL in January. The fact he remains a top-10 player here shows how good his sophomore tape was.

impressive catch radius to be a weapon at tight end.
