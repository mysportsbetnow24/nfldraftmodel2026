While he certainly has the functional strength and movement skills to develop into a high-level starter at either tackle or guard, his tape is a bit more inconsistent than you’d like, without ideal body control or the most consistent positioning. Projection: Round 1/Round 2 That will likely make him a polarizing prospect; it wouldn’t be surprising if some teams had high first-round grades on him, while others weren’t willing to draft him until the second round.

He offers a very impressive combination of range and explosive power, which allows him to reach landmarks and punish opponents. Projection: Round 1/Round 2 Although he generally shows good judgment, Dunker’s intense approach can also lead to occasional issues, mostly concerning his balance, and will likely be difficult to refine out of his game without undermining what makes him special.

Projection: Round 1/Round 2 While Mauigoa may not be the quickest, most agile tackle prospect, he does a nice job of executing with his skillset, avoiding the issues with oversetting, lunging and waist-bending that plague some other prospects with his build.
